```
Goals:
Implementing a server program which will act as a chat server supporting at most 10 clients at a time.
The client program will be able to connent to server at any time and send and receive message to and from the server.
```
```
Finctionalities needed:
• The server should assign a name to each client so that it can differentiate between the
clients.
• Whenever a client joins or sends messages it should displayed in the server's terminal.
• Also when a client sends a message the server should broadcasts to all clients.
• If a client types /exit, /quit or /part, client exits; server broadcasts a message that client(alias)
has left
